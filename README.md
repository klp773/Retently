## Retently Introduction

Retently is a customer experience management platform that helps businesses measure and improve customer satisfaction through NPS (Net Promoter Score), CSAT (Customer Satisfaction Score), and CES (Customer Effort Score) surveys. Founded with the mission to make customer feedback actionable, Retently has evolved from a simple NPS tool into a comprehensive CX management solution.

What sets Retently apart is its focus on automation and integration. The platform automatically sends surveys at critical touchpoints in the customer journey—after purchases, product deliveries, or support interactions. With integrations for over 260 third-party applications including Shopify, HubSpot, Salesforce, Gorgias, and Slack, Retently fits seamlessly into existing workflows.

The platform serves both ecommerce brands and B2B businesses, offering tailored features for each segment. For ecommerce companies, Retently helps track customer experience across the shopping journey from purchase to post-delivery support. B2B businesses use it to gather insights throughout the customer lifecycle, supporting strategic decision-making and long-term engagement.

Key advantages include AI-powered sentiment analysis and text classification, multi-channel survey distribution (email, in-app, web pop-ups, SMS), advanced reporting with trend analysis, and automated follow-up workflows that help teams act on feedback immediately. Companies using Retently report average survey response rates of 37%, significantly higher than industry standards.
